NTestDataBuilder
----------------

NTestDataBuilder provides you with the code instructure to easily and quickly generate test fixture data for your automated tests in a terse, readable and maintainable way using the Test Data Builder pattern.

For more information please see the [blog post](http://robdmoore.id.au/blog/2013/05/26/test-data-generation-the-right-way-object-mother-test-data-builders-nsubstitute-nbuilder/) that gives the theory behind the approach this library was intended for.

NTestDataBuilder is integrated with NSubstitute for proxy/mock/substitute object generation and NBuilder for terse list generation.
